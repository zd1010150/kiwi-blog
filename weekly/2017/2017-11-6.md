* [question] charles can't proxy the chrome http or https request
	[reason] charles can't proxy the request if the request has been established before the charles session is open
	[method] check the SSL  certification in  charles and chrome if are all right(can check follow this [document](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/using-charles/ssl-certificates/)) and then start charles at first and then start the chrome.

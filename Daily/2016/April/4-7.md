1.git 忽略一些文件不加入stage

```
git update-index should do what you want

This will tell git you want to start ignoring the changes to the file

git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file 

;if you use the prior command and de-indexed some files ,you can`t switch your current development branch,you must use the --no-assume-unchanged to indexed that file again.

When you want to start keeping track again
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file
```
